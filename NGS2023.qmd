## How to master 

- Recognize unusual findings
  - Discordant with known knowledge
    - Frequency according to cancer type
    - Unexplained situation 
  - Discordant with other tests 
  
## How to master

- Understand cancer biology
  - Cancer genomics
  - Molecular pathophysiology of cancer
  - Population genetics
  - Treatment
  
## How to master 

- Understand pipeline/Algorithm
  - Why 
  - Statistics
    - Common Assumptions in Statistics
    - Unexplained situation 
  - Discordant with other tests 
  
## How to distinguish?

-   Germline vs Somatic
-   True variant or False

## How reliable?

-   Copy number change
-   Arm-level CN
-   BRCA1/2 exon deletion
-   Tumor cellurarity
-   HRD score
-   Fusion imbalance

## How good are the annotations?

-   Variant pathogenesity
-   Variant nomenclature
-   Tier

## Error

-   PCR (primer) error
-   Base calling error
-   Allignment error
-   Inaccurate estimate
-   Filter out error

## Manual inspection

-   Allele frequency
-   Coverage
-   Strand bias
-   Allignment
-   Visualization
-   Knowledgebase

## Algorithm

-   Maximum likelyhood estimation
-   Basian
-   Burrows--Wheeler transform
-   Filters (No call)
-   Allele-specific copy number analysis
-   Knowledgebase

## OCA CNV

## Gene Level CNV

-   Copy number estimates are made using a proprietary VCIB (Variability Control Informatics Baseline) algorithm
    -   Coverage based estimation
    -   Normalized constant coverage for each gene

## Adjustment with tumor cellularity

$$f \times x + (1 - f) \times 2 = C $$

$$x = (C - (1 - f) \times 2) / f$$

-   f: tumor cellularity
-   C: observed CN

## Adjustment example (raw CN 3)

```{r}
curve( (3 - (1-x) * 2) / x, xlim = c(0.1, 1.0),
       xlab="Tumor cellularity", ylab="Adjusted Copy number")
```
