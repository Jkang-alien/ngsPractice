class: my-one-page-font

>This sequence change replaces glutamic acid with lysine at codon 1895 of the BRCA2 protein (p.Glu1895Lys). The glutamic acid residue is weakly conserved and there is a small physicochemical difference between glutamic acid and lysine. This variant is present in population databases (rs146351301, ExAC 0.009%). This variant has been reported in individuals affected with breast cancer (PMID: 25682074, 20104584, 27257965, 28664449). In the literature, this variant is also known as 5911G>A. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 142307). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function output the following: SIFT: "Tolerated"; PolyPhen-2: "Benign"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0". The lysine amino acid residue is found in multiple mammalian species, suggesting that this missense change does not adversely affect protein function. These predictions have not been confirmed by published functional studies and their clinical significance is uncertain. In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.

Finally, three sequence variants â€“ BRCA2 c.9976A>T (BIC: K3326X), c.10095delCins11 (BIC: 10323delCins11) and c.10150C>T (BIC: **R3384X**) predicted to result in protein truncation were ruled as exceptions that **could not be classified** because of their **location near the 3Â´-end** and possibly dispensable part of the gene.

# Clinvar

BRCA2 c.9976A>T (p.Lys3326*) variant, located upstream of this variant and also in the last exon of the gene, is a known benign variant.
